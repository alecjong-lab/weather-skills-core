"""Lint-run orchestration and the deterministic score rubric.

Scoring: each skill's score is the mean of its per-rule scores, on a 0-100
scale. A rule with no findings for the skill scores 1.0; otherwise the rule
scores by its worst finding's severity -- ``error`` 0.0, ``warning`` 0.5,
``info`` 0.8. The rules in the denominator are the active per-skill rules plus, when
a corpus beyond the target exists, the active cross-skill rules; rules that
did not run (skipped for lack of a corpus, or not in the resolved rule set)
are excluded from the denominator entirely (never silently scored as clean). A
skill whose script could not be analyzed (WSK001) scores 0. The aggregate is
the mean of the per-skill scores. Scores inform; maintainers decide.
